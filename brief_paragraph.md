Most talk about race relations from members of the  Columbia City Council  came in the wake of a Facebook post by the Columbia Police Officers Association declaring a "Darren Wilson Day," honoring the white police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson last year. 

At the Aug. 17 meeting, Fifth Ward Councilwoman Laura Nauser joined fellow council members in roundly condemning CPOA executive director Dale Roberts for a series of what she called "sexist, racist, and divisive comments." 

Other conversations about race relations were most sparked by public comments from members of the activist group Race Matters, who urged the council to direct the Columbia Police Department to work more closely and compassionately with the black community.

At the October 5 meeting, Fourth Ward Councilman Ian Thomas said public commentary from Race Matters members had given him an "epiphany" regarding the pervasiveness of racism in the community  and led him to study the history of racial discrimination in the U.S.
