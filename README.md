# PDF assignment (Nov. 30)

This one should be short and easy. Simply take the PDFs included in the "minutes" folder (they're minutes from Columbia City Council meetings since August), turn it into text, and use that to answer this question:

  - Pretend you're on deadline and your editor asks you: In what ways has the Columbia City Council discussed or addressed the issue of racial unrest in the community since the school year started? Search through the documents and type up a paragraph that answers the question.

A couple tips:

  - You can search through multiple text files in a single directory at once from the command line. Try the command "cat *.txt | grep 'YOUR SEARCH TERM HERE'"

  - Or, if you prefer, you can concatenate all the text files into a single file, using a command like this: "cat *.txt > all_text.txt"

This assignment will be due **Friday, Dec. 4.** Just check in a text file into your Github repository showing the commands you used to perform the conversion and search, then a brief paragraph outlining your findings.
